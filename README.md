## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology and Findings

### 1. Data Extraction and Cleaning

- Downloaded data for `'Adj Close'` prices, `'Volume'`, `'Open'`, `'High'`, and `'Low'` using `yfinance`.
- Processed initial MultiIndex columns to extract `'Adj Close'` prices, resulting in a cleaner DataFrame.
- Checked for missing values: **No missing values found in 'Adj Close' prices after initial load.**
